		<h1>Punting / Special Teams</h1>
		<p>I'm extremely passionate about football, particularly punting. I played two years of football in high school, three semesters (and counting!) of intramural flag football, and I've spent two seasons coaching kickers and punters at my alma mater, Ann Arbor Pioneer High School. My freshman year of college, once January hit and it got too frosty for us to throw the ball in the parking lot behind our dorm, I fulfilled my heart's desire to play football by learning to long snap in our hallway.</p>
		<p>I focus most of my attention on punting. I'm a lefty, and I can probably average about 38 yards and 4.0 hang time. My good punts go 45+ with 4.3-4.4 of hang time, but I need to work on my consistency, which I'm doing this winter thanks to the indoor fitness studio in my dorm giving me a venue to practice taking snaps and drops. I'm looking forward to seeing long term results of better consistency as it warms up in the spring.</p>
		<p>Below, you'll find a gallery of various action shots of me punting and kicking.</p>

		<h1>Reading</h1>
		<p>For the first time since middle school, I've finally taken up leisurely reading once more, and I'm glad I have. I'm very much into books on self-betterment and how the body and mind function and can be manipulated. Some books I've read this year include Harold White's <em>Max Out Your Life</em>, John Maxwell's <em>15 Invaluable Laws of Growth</em>, David Goggins' <em>Can't Hurt Me</em>, and Daniel Pink's <em>When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing</em>. As of writing this, I'm wrapping up Carol Dweck's <em>Mindset</em>.</p>

		<h1>Unicycling</h1>
		<p>My freshman year, my friend-turned-suitemate Vincent and I decided to learn to unicycle over the summer. I'm not great at it, but I can hold my own for some distance and I've made more friends this year who unicycle, so I'm looking forward to my continued improvement. I also dabbled in juggling my freshman year, so if anyone is in need of a clown...</p>
